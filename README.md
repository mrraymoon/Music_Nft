# Music_Nft
A smart contract for music NFTs

Music NFT is an NFT smart contract that let's users -

    - Mints new music NFTs with price tag
    - Sell off the NFT to other users
    - Buy NFTs from other users
    - Rent out the NFT to other users for a specific duration
        - The amount paid for each rent is dependent on the duration
        - Renters pay 1/100 of the NFT price for each day in rent
        - Only one user can rent a music NFT per time
        - When the rent is due, the NFT owner can "retrieve" the NFT from the user renting it
